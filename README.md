# JuliaCon19-Sketchy-PDEOpt

This is a proof of concept implementation of sketching for PDE-constrained Optimization. 
We leverage recent advances in randomized sketching algorithms to develop low memory optimization recipes. 

This implementation is currently in accordance with Julia-v0.6.x and being ported to v1.0.x
